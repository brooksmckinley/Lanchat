# Lanchat

A basic multicast-based messenger written in Java

For some reason I thought it would be funny to build a messenger over multicast. It kinda was. If you can somehow think of
any use for it, try it out. 

## Features

* You can chat over it
* Multiple channels
* Configurable multicast group and network interface
* Reliable message delivery
